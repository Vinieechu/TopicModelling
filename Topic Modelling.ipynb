    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Analysis is used for summarizing or getting useful information out of a large amount of unstructured text stored in documents. This opens up the opportunity of using text data alongside more conventional data sources (e.g, surveys and administrative data). The goal of text analysis is to take a large corpus of complex and unstructured text data and extract important and meaningful messages in a comprehensible meaningful way. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Analysis can help with the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Informationan retrieval**: Help find relevant information in large databases such as a systematic literature review. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clustering and text categorization**: Techniques like topic modeling can summarize a large corpus of text by finding the most important phrases. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text Summarization**: Create category-sensitive text summaries of a large corpus of text. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Machine Translation**: Translate from one language to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are going to analyze job advertisements from 2010-2015 using topic modeling to examine the content of our data and document classification to tag the type of job in the advertisement. First we will go over how to transform our data into a matrix that can be read in by an algorithm. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Glossary of Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Corpus**: A corpus of documents is the set of all documents in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tokenize**: Tokenization is the process by which text is sepearated into meaningful terms or phrases. In english this is fairly triial as words as separated by whitespace. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stemming**: Stemming is a type of text normalization where words that have different forms but their essential meaning at the same are normalized to the original dictionary form of a word. For example \"go,\" \"went,\" and \"goes\" all stem from the lemma \"go.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **TFIDF**: TFIDF (Term frequency-inverse document frequency) is an example of feature enginnering where the most important words are extracted by taking account their frequency in documents and the entire corpus of documents as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Topic Modeling**: Topic modeling is an unsupervised learning method where groups of co-occuring words are clustered into topics. Typically, the words in a cluster should be related and make sense (e.g, boat, ship, captain). Individual documents will then fall into multiple topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **LDA**: LDA (latent Dirichlet allocation) is a type of probabilistic model commonly used for topic modelling. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stop Words**: Stop words are words that have little semantic meaning like prepositions, articles and common nouns. They can often be ignored. "

Each of these steps will be discussed below. The ultimate goal is to transform our text data into a form of algorithm we can work with. A sequence of symbols cannot be fed directly into an algorithm. Algorithms expect numerical feature vectors with fixed size rather then a document with a variable document length. We will be transforming our text corpus into a bag of n-grams to be further analyzed. In this form our text data is represented as a matrix where each row refers to a specific job description (document) and each column is the occurence of a word (feature)."
